#### DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ####

reference: Cuda by Example - An introduction to general-purpose GPU programming (2010, chapter 2)


hardware/software components required for building code in CUDA C:
- A CUDA-enabled GPU
- An NVIDIA device driver
- A CUDA development kit
- A standard C compiler

### NVIDIA DEVICE DRIVER ###
Ensure that the drivers for your NVIDIA GPU is up-to-date with the latest 
NVIDIA system software.
Visit www.nvidia.com/cuda and click the "Download Drivers" link

### CUDA SKD ###
The CUDA C applications are going to be computing on 2 different processors,
therefore you are going to need 2 compilers: one compiler will compile code for
your GPU, and one compiler will compile code for your CPU.

NVIDIA provides the compiler gor your GPU code and you can download the CUDA
Toolkit at http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpucomputing.html. Click the CUDA
Toolkit link to reach the download page.
